here I am 
alone in my home
no one is with me
no one to call my own
the candle light flickers
shadows play on the wall
still no one will knock and
nobody calls

so i slam down the whiskey
take a few shots of rum
feel good for a time
my mind is numb
wake up the next day
on my kitchen floor
still the feeling hasn't changed
I'm alone once more

I close my eyes
and i see her face
a flicker of light
in a deep dark place
her big blue eyes
the way that she smells
living without her
is a living hell

I open my eyes
and stare straight ahead
emptiness returns
my soul is dead
I'm destined to be lonely
for the rest of my life
while the girl of my dreams
is another mans' wife
